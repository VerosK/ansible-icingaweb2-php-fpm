# ansible role VerosK.icingaweb2-php-fpm

This sets up icingaweb2 with php-fpm. Although it works (in production),
it's still more proof of concept.

Update 2018-08: Has some issues with Icinga 2.9+ and aNag, but nobody is using CGIs in 2018, isn't it?

Works on CentOS but can be updated to Debian easily.
